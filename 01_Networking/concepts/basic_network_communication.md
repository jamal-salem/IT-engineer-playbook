# Basic Network Communication

## Purpose
Explain how devices communicate in a simple network environment.

## Core idea
When two devices communicate, several layers of logic are involved:
- Physical connection
- Data link addressing
- Logical addressing
- Protocol rules

## What happens conceptually
- Devices identify each other using hardware addresses.
- Logical addresses are used to locate devices in a network.
- Intermediate devices forward data based on learned information.

## Why this matters
Understanding this flow is critical for troubleshooting, automation, and system design.

## Engineer notes
Most network problems occur because one of these steps fails silently.
