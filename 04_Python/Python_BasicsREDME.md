Print Statement

The `print()` function is used to display output to the screen.

It is often the first instruction learned in any programming language.

Example:
```python
print("Hello, world!")

```

numbers_and_math

```python
#This program adds two numbers

num1 = 1
num2 = 2

#Add two numbers

sum = num1 + num2

#Display the sum

print("The sum of the numbers is:", sum)
```

#Python supports basic arithmetic operations.

Examples:
```python
print(5 + 3)
print(10 - 4)
print(6 * 2)
print(8 / 2)
```







### Python_Introduction
Understanding Python: The Language of Instructions

Just as humans use language to communicate and exchange instructions, computers do the same. However, computers communicate using specialized languages such as Python, C++, and Java. To deliver instructions to a machine, programmers must organize their ideas and concepts into a language the computer can process.

### Syntax vs. Semantics

## Syntax:
This consists of the words representing objects and commands, along with punctuation that provides structure, hierarchy, and context to the code.

## Semantics:
This is the actual meaning conveyed by the syntax. While syntax is the "grammar," semantics is the "intent" behind the operations.

### How to Master the Language:

Exposure: The best way to learn is through consistent practice and reading code written by others.

Style Conventions: Professional developers follow general conventions (such as PEP 8) to maintain stylistic uniformity and readability within the language.

### Variables: 
These represent stored data as strings, sets, dictionaries, lists, and objects (Note: Future readings will explain these categories).
