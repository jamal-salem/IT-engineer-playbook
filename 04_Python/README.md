# Python for IT Engineers

This section covers Python from an IT engineering perspective.

Python is used here as:
- A logic and problem-solving tool
- An automation language for systems and networks
- A bridge between operating systems and infrastructure

This is not application development.
This is Python for real-world IT operations.
