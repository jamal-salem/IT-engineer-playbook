# Network Connectivity Issue on Windows

Scenario:
A Windows system reports network connectivity issues while other devices
on the same network are functioning normally.

This scenario focuses on:
- Identifying whether the issue is system-level or network-level
- Understanding how Windows detects network problems
- Applying structured troubleshooting logic

The goal is to resolve the issue methodically, not by trial and error.
