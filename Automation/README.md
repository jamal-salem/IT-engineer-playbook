# Automation for IT Engineers

This section focuses on automation from an IT engineering perspective.

Automation here means:
- Reducing repetitive operational work
- Enforcing consistency across systems
- Improving reliability and scalability
- Integrating multiple systems into a single workflow

This is not scripting for learning purposes.
This is automation for real-world IT operations.
